I want you to create a tool for me that scans for photos and videos under a source directory, and copies them into an organized structure in a destination directory. Validate that the source and destination directories are not under each other, they should be seperate locations. The structure under the destination directory should be a series of directories for each year e.g. 2002, etc. Under each year's directory there should be subdirectories for each month i.e. jan, feb, etc. Under each month's directory their should be two folders, pics and videos. The pictures and videos should reside in the respective third level directory i.e. year -> month -> pics -> picture file. A directory should only be created if there is actual data in it, i.e. actual picture or video. Create a log, that tracks each copy operation, source and destination. Each lineitem in the log should mention the copy operation and if it succeeded or failed. Name the logfile using the <timestamp>.log format. At the top mention the source -> destination. Then each line either mentions a copy operation or a directory creation operation and if it succeeded or failed (including failure reason). Make the tool a gui tool that can run across operating systems. The tool should allow us to navigate and pic source and destination folders and should do the validation mentioned above. So the tool should first scan the source directory tree heirarchy and pickup all image and video files. It should look at file's creation time and then figure out where in the destination directory it should go. Optimize this process as much as possible.
