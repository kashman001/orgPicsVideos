# OrgPicsVideos

Cross-platform GUI tool that scans a source directory for photos and videos and copies them into an organized destination structure:

```
<dest>/<year>/<month>/pics/<file>
<dest>/<year>/<month>/videos/<file>
```

The tool validates that the source and destination directories are distinct and not nested. It creates directories only when there is content and writes a timestamped log of all operations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- PySide6

## Install

```
pip install -e .
```

## Run

```
orgpicsvideos
```

## User Guide

See `docs/user_guide.md` for the full user guide.

## Log format

A log file named `<timestamp>.log` is written under the destination directory. The first line states the source and destination, followed by one line per directory creation or copy operation:

```
SOURCE -> DEST: /path/source -> /path/dest
mkdir /path/dest/2024/jan/pics [SUCCESS]
copy /path/source/img.jpg -> /path/dest/2024/jan/pics/img.jpg [SUCCESS]
```

## Notes

- File timestamps are based on best-effort creation time. If creation time is unavailable, metadata change time or modification time is used.
- Filename collisions are resolved by appending a numeric suffix (`_1`, `_2`, ...).
